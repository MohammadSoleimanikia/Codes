# Authentication Project

## Level 2: Hashing with bcrypt
In this level, we use bcrypt for hashing passwords. Bcrypt is a popular and secure hashing algorithm that helps protect passwords by making it computationally expensive for attackers to crack them.

## Level 3: Salting
In the next level, we enhance security by using salting. Salting involves adding a unique value to each password before hashing it, which ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different.

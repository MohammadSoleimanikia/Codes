# Level 1 Authentication: User and Password

This project demonstrates a basic level one authentication system using a username and password. It includes functionalities to add a new user and to log in with existing user credentials.

## Overview

Level one authentication involves verifying a user's identity using a username and password. While this method is simple and widely used, it has significant security vulnerabilities. If an attacker gains access to our database, they can potentially access all stored usernames and passwords.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account by providing a username and password.
- **User Login**: Enables existing users to log in using their username and password.

# Splitting Components By Feature & State
* in our example all of the features and codes used in a single file App.JSX
* each feature should added into another component 

## pros
* if we add all codes inside app.jsx if each state variable updated all of the app.jsx is also updated and all of its all of its  codes 
* when we split codes into multiple component each state variable update make the related component update and not all of the codes .
